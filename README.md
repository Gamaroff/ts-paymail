## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a robust and versatile TypeScript library for Bitcoin SV (BSV) Paymail, aimed at enhancing the integration and functionality of Paymail in the BSV blockchain ecosystem. This library will focus on two primary components:

1. **Server Development**: Building a comprehensive server setup that supports service discovery and a variety of capabilities. It will include default functionalities like P2P Destinations, Receive Raw Transaction, Public Profile, and the flexibility for developers to incorporate additional custom capabilities.

2. **Client Implementation**: Creating client-side features to facilitate host and capability discovery in both Node.js and browser environments. This will involve developing methods for seamless interaction with the server's provided capabilities.

The project aims to streamline the process of integrating BSV Paymail into various applications, promoting broader adoption and utility within the BSV ecosystem.
